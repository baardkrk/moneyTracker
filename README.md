# Money Tracker

Budgeting application that automatically tags the transactions downloaded from your bank. You download the transaction transcript from your bank, and load it into the app. Then, you manually tag the transactions from a specific place *once*, then the app tags them the rest of the time.

You can also create a budget, and get a monthly report based on your actual spending. Each transaction will be tagged to a specific category in the budget. You can then examine which transactions was done for each category in the budget if you overspend or need to adjust it.
